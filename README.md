### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.



### Useful resources

- [Scrimba resource 1](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel/) - This resource provided me with a wonderful instructor known as Kevin Powell who did a great job by showing good practices and tips to build more responsive websites.

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed successfully with the help of Kevin Powell in conjunction with Scrimba. I feel like my dev skills are on the next level due to the fact Kevin Powell- an excellent teacher by the way exposed me to new development skills I had not encountered before. Through him challenging me and not entirely holding my hand all the way, giving me a push where needed, I was able to complete this wonderful project. This has been an exciting journey and I canâ€™t wait to get even better further along my development journey.
